# Contributor Code of Conduct

I don't believe in such things, but I ask that you: 

 * Respect the rules of the hosting website (i.e., Github)
 * Be open to critism in an emotionally detached way
 * Facilitate freedom of speech in an emotionally detached way
 * Only engage in intellectual discussion detached from your person and perception of other persons.
 * Do not misrepresent your ownership of the material, and follow provided copyright ruling included in the project
 * Try not use this repository or technology to negatively impact the world & people
 * Understand that the lack of rules means potentially inconsistent rulings, and that it will be conducted as a dictatorship, not a democracy:
   * If you are unhappy with that, feel free to fork the repository and start your own community to continue work
   * All rulings are subject to reversal at any time, for any reason, especially in light of a solid counter argument to the ruling

Thanks.
