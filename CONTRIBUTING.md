# Contributing

Let's stay organized. Please open a discussion with your proposal or criticism through the 'discussions' tab. Upon approval, a coordinator (probably @robbie-vanderzee) will create an issue and you can make a pull request tagging that issue. Follow the commit size and message standards set by previous commits:

 * General idea (#Issue number):
      - Item Alpha
      - Item Beta

Your commit must create sufficient tests, and pass all tests. If your change involves removing tests, you must explain why thouroughly. Your contribution must pass build integration for merge. All merges must be approved by a lead team member (probably @robbie-vanderzee).

Also, If your change is significant enough, please fork the repository.

Thanks.
